# Try with Mirra Coding Challenge

This challenge is designed to test your creativity, coding skills, and ability to integrate third-party APIs into a functional application. Your completed project will be used to discuss your approach to solving problems and your technical skills.

## Challenge Overview

Your task is simple but open-ended: **Create an application that utilizes the Ticketmaster API to display events to the user.** You're free to choose any programming language and framework; the goal is to see how you approach problem-solving and API integration.

### Requirements
